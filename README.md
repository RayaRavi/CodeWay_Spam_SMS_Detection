Dataset link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset
# Description : 
This repository hosts a machine learning project dedicated to the detection of spam SMS messages. 
Leveraging the "SMS Spam Collection Dataset," which comprises labeled SMS messages indicating whether they are spam or legitimate, the project aims to build an efficient AI model capable of accurately classifying incoming SMS messages.
The project employs advanced techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings to extract relevant features from the text data. 
Additionally, popular classification algorithms including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines are implemented to train and evaluate the models.
# Key Features:
Utilizes the SMS Spam Collection Dataset for training and evaluation.
Implements TF-IDF or word embeddings for feature extraction from text data.
Incorporates diverse classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines.
Provides comprehensive evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Includes thorough documentation and code comments to facilitate understanding and replication of the project.
